Drive your car to the Supermarket, park and catch the Trolley... plus you can grab some groceries at the store when you pick up your car and head back to the Resort. My family and I have walked down Roaring Fork Road about a 1/2 mile or less, and catching theTrolley to downtown Gatlinburg .  The harder part after you catch the Trolley back up to the Resort, is the uphill walk back up Roaring Fork Road.  Good exercise but not for everyone.

One at the front door and one for the parking area. Please do not block the shared driveway.During winter months an AWD or 4x4 is recommended if snow is present. Coming up our driveway does gain elevation for the Incredible View.",,,"Our cabin does use a septic system so please only flush toilet paper down the toilet.

Yes, the cabin offers romantic amenities such as a king-size bed and a jetted tub in the primary suite, an outdoor hot tub on the wraparound lower deck, a stacked-stone wood-burning fireplace, and a private balcony where you can gaze up at the stars. But because Lovers’ Hideaway also has a queen-size sofa bed, 2 full bathrooms, a pool table, and an arcade table, you can easily bring the kids along for a family vacation. You can even bring your pets! All four legged friends are welcome.  Situated on a ridge amid stately trees. Lovers’ Hideaway offers plenty of privacy. Yet it’s surprisingly close to restaurants, shops, and attractions. Downtown Gatlinburg, for instance, is only 10 minutes away, and you can drive to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the Great Smoky Arts & Crafts Community, and Dollywood, among other destinations, in less than a half-hour. What’s more, when you stay here in the summer, you’ll have free access to 3 nearby pool areas where you can swim, laze on a poolside chaise, and play ping-pong, shuffleboard, and other games.  However, you don’t have to leave Lovers’ Hideaway to have a great time. Atop the living room fireplace is a 42’ HDTV with cable; you can watch a movie while snuggling on the luxe leather sofa. There’s a full-size pool table just behind the couch; like many of the cabin’s other furnishings, it was crafted from logs, giving it a rustic elegance that beautifully complements the wood-planked walls and floor. If the pool’s not your game, sit down at the arcade table—though if you’re vacationing with the kids, they may have beaten you to it.  Thanks to Lovers’ Hideaway’s convenient location, there are scores of restaurants nearby, offering just about every type of cuisine you can imagine. Sometimes, though, it’s more relaxing to dine in. Fortunately the kitchen is equipped with all the appliances, gadgets, cookware, and tableware you could need, no matter how elaborate a meal you have in mind. Go ahead, surf the web using the free WIFI service. You may even find a recipe you’d never have time to make at home. There’s a park-style charcoal grill outside as well—perfect if you reel in some trout from one of the nearby streams. Plus a dishwasher to make cleanup a snap. The dining table can seat up to 6 people, and after the plates are cleared it makes a great game table.  The primary suite is upstairs; in fact, it makes up the entire loft level. Like the rest of Lovers’ Hideaway, it boasts lustrous wooden floors, and artful log-style furnishings. Before you retire to the sumptuous king-size bed—perhaps to watch a romantic movie on the 32” TV—you can luxuriate in the suite’s jetted tub. If a long soak among its pulsating jets of steamy water doesn’t put you in the mood for romance, a nightcap out on the loft’s private balcony will. Sit back on the rocking chairs with a glass of wine and gaze up at the twinkling stars as crickets chirp and owls hoot—it’s a magical experience you’ll long remember.  In addition to a jetted tub, the primary suite has a full bathroom with a walk-in shower. A 2nd full bathroom, with a combination shower/tub, is on the main floor, which is especially convenient if you’ve brought the kids along. We’ll provide plenty of clean towels and bedding, so you don’t have to load up your suitcase with your own linens from home. In fact, you can pack extra light, as Lovers’ Hideaway includes a washer and dryer.  Whether you’re coming to Gatlinburg for romance or family fun, Lovers’ Hideaway is a charming, perfectly located cabin to serve as your home base.

Because of the topographic terrain of Gatlinburg/ Pigeon Forge many cabins with beautiful views or just a mountain setting are located in very steep roads which is very common for this area. Our cabin is located at the top of Sky Harbor ( Top of the Mountain)  and it has a nice flat driveway. Going up it will be 2 miles up the mountain and it does have some curvy roads which is the norm to this area of Tennessee.Other things to noteDo I need a 4WD or AWD to your cabin? . Although all roads are paved and maintained by the private HOA, it is not uncommon that in late fall , winter and early spring to have hazard road conditions.

Maximum Occupancy: 4 – No exceptions
Our cabin is a small cabin and there is not enough accommodation for more than 2 Adults/ 2 children or maximum 3 adults. 4 Adults will not be allowed. 
 If evidence is found that more than the approved number of guests has stayed in the cabin without permission, additional charges will incur. 

DAMAGE: VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!
Guests agree to leave the property in the same condition they found it upon arrival.  If property is not left in the same condition, the Guests understand, and agree that management reserves the right to charge the Guests for any repairs or additional cleaning.  Since we do not charge a Damage Deposit, we expect Guests to help with the upkeep of keeping the cabin the way you found it.  If you break something, please claim responsibility and call, email or text us for a replacement to be made.  
If linens are lost or severely damaged you will be charged at current retail value and this goes for anything that goes missing. 

MOUNTAIN ROADS
Most roads in the area are well maintained, but some are curvy because of the topography of the mountains. The roads at SKY Harbor are paved and maintained routinely although in late fall, winter and early spring it is not uncommon to occasionally have hazardous road conditions if it has snowed or if frozen ice showers have fallen. It is recommended that during late fall and winter have a four-wheel drive and /or chains. You are responsible for your transportation. We cannot provide transportation nor are we responsible for any towing charges you may incur during your stay.  

WILD LIFE
While the cabins are sprayed monthly for pests, wasps, ladybugs and other insects sometimes these creatures still find their way indoors.  Remember that we are in the Great Smoky Mountains and sometimes we have these unwanted guests. While we cannot make refund for insects or wildlife encounters, should it arise, we will take the appropriate measures to correct the problem. Remember this is not your common back yard as such you are likely to encounter a Bear, Deer, Turkey, Bats, Ladybugs, Carpenter Bees, Wasps, Scorpions, Ticks, Chiggers. 
Sometimes, a bear may wonder from the National Park to one of the cabins. Please DO NOT approach a bear; do not feed any animal as the owners will not accept responsibility for any injury or illness caused by wildlife. Refunds are not given due to insect or animal issues. Always keep an eye on the children on the outdoors.
Please do not take lightly the possibility of a bear in the area, if you have children please do not leave unattended playing outside. 
FEEDING THE ANIMALS OR NOT SECURING YOUR TRASH CAN RESULT IN BODILY INJURY.


POWER OUTRAGES
Sometimes in the mountains we experience power outages. If the power goes out then the well will stop working as well. You will not have water until the power comes back on. A well requires electricity to work. Having an extra gallon of water on hand is always a good idea. You can at least have something to drink or wash your hands. Flushing the toilet also requires water. Being prepared can make the difference. If you do experience a power outage, contact Sevier County Electric System at (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN). 

ITEMS LEFT BEHIND
Owners are not responsible for any items left behind and do not offer shipping of any kind unless guest wants to pay a $35 trip fee that our cleaners charge to go get your things plus shipping fee. It is illegal to ship prescription drugs so double check every spot before you leave the cabin.  

NO DAILY MAID SERVICE- While linens, bath towels and a starter kit are included in the cabin; daily maid service is not included in your rental rate. You may want to bring extra of everything. Keep in mind we are not a hotel and we are only owners renting you our home to you.

HOT TUBS:

Hot tubs are not intended to be “swimming pools” and children are NOT to be in the hot tubs, for safety reasons.

There is no life guard on duty to supervise!  Do not turn the hot tubs off, as it takes several hours for them to reheat.  Hot tubs will run on a cycle of circulating the water, so it will appear to be “off” at times, but it is still on.

Romantically nestled in the woods, this authentic log cabin is located half way between Gatlinburg (6mi) & Pigeon Forge (5mi) this studio cabin has a full kitchen, wood burning fireplace, jacuzzi tub, private outdoor jacuzzi, luxurious king bed and roku TV. Escape to your own slice of rustic paradise, surrounded by the stunning peace and beauty of the Great Smoky MountainsThe space“Honeysuckle Hideaway” is designed as a romantic and cozy getaway for couples young and old. Relax, unwind and make lasting memories with the one you love!  You can enjoy apparent seclusion all while being with 15 mins of the main attractions in both Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The cabin is located at the top of persimmon mountain at the end of a private road with only 4 other small cabins. Smell the flowers, listen to the birds chirp and enjoy a strong chance to witness the magic of a momma bear and her cubs wondering the area. We are also easy to get to on back roads which can be very handy as a way to avoid the bumper to bumper traffic on the parkway.The cabin is located on top of a private road. We are in a very limited signal area and rely on Viperbroadband for WiFI and Roku TV streaming. WIFI can be spotty and is slower than off the mountain. If you do plan to work or are in need of phone service at all times while in the cabin it would be wise to book elsewhere. Honeysuckle hideaway is for those wanting to unplug and enjoy the mountains.  Cellular service can be iffy so it is recommended you connect to WiFi calling once you reach the cabin. We are a true mountain log cabin and the majority of cabins in the area do not provide internet but we are providing the best available for us at this time. **NOTE: the last 1/4 mile to the cabin is on a gravel road, there is a curve which does require a three point turn half way up (please see pictures in listing for images of the road and sharp left turn). The vast majority of our guests have no issues at all with the driveway and to us it is part of the mountain experience, however if you are uncomfortable with driving on an inclined gravel road this is not the cabin for you. If you are looking for a true couples' mountain getaway we cannot wait to host you!Guest accessKeypad for easy self check in",,,,,,,,,"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/63837c65-5fb8-4b85-9e25-28ec720b1e7b.jpg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5bc31ae0-6cbe-4e5b-acf9-d26bdf56efa9.jpg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/632d98c6-0610-4501-b661-b5fa302db1f8.jpg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1fae0039-d1f2-4996-a847-3477bbf12535.jpg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8a54e99b-7a65-4cae-9afd-dcd775cee6db.jpg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/390cdeee-5070-4fe2-bf11-3eb53c89a5f8.jpg?im_w=720"

Warning: Bears are wild animals that are dangerous and unpredictable. Do not approach bears or allow them to approach you!
Willfully approaching within 50 yards (150 feet), or any distance that disturbs or displaces a bear, is illegal in the park.Violation of this federal regulation can result in fines and arrest. Use binoculars, telephoto lens, or a spotting scope to view the animals.
Check the ""Bear Closures"" and ""Bear Warnings"" section of the Temporary Closures page before planning a hike in the park.

Attacks on humans are rare. If you are physically attacked by a black bear, fight back aggressively with any available object--the bear may consider you as prey! Do not ""play dead."" Help protect others by reporting all bear incidents to a park ranger immediately. Keep your distance from bears.

What Do I Do If I See A Bear?
Bears in the park or at your cabin are wild and their behavior can be unpredictable. Although extremely rare, attacks on humans have occurred, inflicting serious injuries and death. Treat bear encounters with extreme caution! Learn what to do if you see a bear by watching this short video.
If you see a bear:

Remain watchful.

Do not approach it

Do not allow the bear to approach you.

If your presence causes the bear to change its behavior (stops feeding, changes its travel direction, watches you, etc.) you are too close.

Being too close may promote aggressive behavior from the bear such as running toward you, making loud noises, or swatting the ground. The bear is demanding more space. Don't run, but slowly back away, watching the bear. Increase the distance between you and the bear. The bear will probably do the same.

If a bear persistently follows or approaches you, without vocalizing, or paw swatting:

Change your direction.

If the bear continues to follow you, stand your ground.

If the bear gets closer, talk loudly or shout at it.

Act aggressively to intimidate the bear.

Act together as a group if you have companions. Make yourselves look as large as possible (for example, move to higher ground).

Throw non-food objects such as rocks at the bear.

Use a deterrent such as a stout stick.

Don't run and don't turn away from the bear.

Don't leave food for the bear; this encourages further problems.

If the bear's behavior indicates that it is after your food and you are physically attacked:

Separate yourself from the food.

Slowly back away.

If the bear shows no interest in your food and you are physically attacked, the bear may consider you as prey:

Fight back aggressively with any available object!

Do not play dead!

Help protect others, report all bear incidents to a park ranger immediately. Above all, keep your distance from bears! 

Stay safe in black bear country! Please watch this short video.

 Black bears are dangerous and unpredictable wild animals. Do not approach bears or allow them to approach you.

Bears in the Smokies
Great Smoky Mountains National Park is one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States where black bears can live in wild, natural surroundings.
Bears inhabit all elevations of the park. Though populations are variable, biologists estimate that roughly 1,500 bears live in the park. This equals a population density of approximately two bears per square mile. At one time, the black bear's range included most of North America except the extreme west coast. However loss of habitat has resulted in a significant reduction in this range.

Black bears in the Smokies are black in color, but in other parts of the country they may be brown or cinnamon. They may be six feet in length and up to three feet high at the shoulder. During the summer months, a typical adult male bear weighs approximately 250 pounds while adult females are generally smaller and weigh slightly over 100 pounds. However, bears may double their weight by the fall. Bears over 600 pounds have been documented in the park. Bears can live 12-15 years or more, however bears which have had access to human foods and garbage have a life expectancy of only half that time.

Bears, like humans, are omnivores. Plant materials such as berries and nuts make up approximately 85% of their diet. Insects and animal carrion provide valuable sources of protein for bears. 

Bears have color vision and a keen sense of smell. In addition, they are good tree climbers, can swim very well, and can run 30 miles per hour.

Bear Behavior
Bears are most active during early morning and late evening hours in spring and summer. Mating usually takes place in July. Both female and male bears may have more than one mate during the summer.

Bears choose a denning site with the coming of cold weather. Dens are usually hollow stumps, tree cavities, or wherever there is shelter. Bears in the Smokies are unusual in that they often den high above the ground in standing hollow trees. Bears do not truly hibernate, but enter long periods of sleep. They may leave the den for short periods if disturbed or during brief warming trends.

One to four cubs are born during the mother's winter sleep, usually in late January or early February. Bears weigh eight ounces at birth. Females with newly born cubs usually emerge from their winter dens in late March or early April. Commonly born in pairs, the cubs will remain with the mother for about eighteen months or until she mates again.
 
The park has replaced garbage cans with bear proof dumpsters to prevent bears from gaining access to garbage.

Garbage Kills Bears!
The bear's keen sense of smell leads it to insects, nuts and berries, but the animal is also enticed by the tantalizing smells of human food and garbage such as hot dogs, apple cores, chips, and watermelon rinds left on the ground in picnic areas, campgrounds, and along trails. Feeding bears or allowing them access to human food and garbage causes a number of problems:

It changes the bear's behavior and causes them to lose their instinctive fear of humans. Over time, these bears may begin approaching people in search of food and may become more unpredictable and dangerous.

Bears that obtain human food and garbage damage property and injure people. These bears pose a risk to public safety. They can also teach other bears this dangerous behavior. Often, they must be euthanized.

Studies have shown that bears that lose their fear of people by obtaining human food and garbage never live as long as bears that feed on natural foods and are shy and afraid of people. Many are hit by cars and become easy targets for poachers.

For these reasons, park rangers issue citations for littering, feeding bears, and for improper food storage. These citations can result in fines of up to $5,000 and jail sentences lasting up to six months. Visitors are urged to view all wildlife at a safe distance and to never throw food or garbage on the ground or leave it unattended. Garbage Kills Bears!
 
Help keep the bears wild. Do not feed bears. Remember, a fed bear is a dead bear!

Bear management is really people management. How visitors behave while in the park has an impact on the safety of bears. If you are careless with your food or litter, YOU may be responsible for a bear's death!
The park has done many things to make it easier for you to protect bears. Bear proof dumpsters or trash cans can be found in all campgrounds and picnic areas. Please use them to dispose of garbage.
During summer months, some of the busiest picnic areas close at 8:00 PM so these areas can be thoroughly cleaned before dark and any food scraps or trash left by careless visitors can be removed. Park rangers patrol picnic areas and campgrounds to enforce evening closures, littering and food storage regulations. They also strictly enforce regulations that prohibit approaching, harassing, disturbing or feeding bears.
An army of park volunteers patrol the park's most popular trails, picnic areas, and campgrounds to educate visitors about protecting bears. They confiscate unattended food or coolers and clean up food scraps left behind by careless visitors. These volunteers also assist in managing people during roadside bear jams.
In the backcountry, food storage cables have been installed to make it easier for backpackers to hang their food and garbage so that bears cannot get to it. At some campsites, telephone poles were flown into remote backcountry areas because the trees around the campsites were too small to set up an effective cable system!
The park's Resource Education staff provides information about bears at visitor centers, in the park's newspaper, and at evening programs. Educational signs about bears can be found on picnic tables throughout the park and bear safety videos are posted on this website.
Wildlife managers actively monitor for bear activity and use innovative and proactive techniques to keep bears shy, secretive, and afraid of people. This approach allows bears to remain in their home range, and discourages them from visiting developed areas or approaching people.
Results of these efforts are very encouraging. In some areas the number of bears that have to be trapped and moved away has decreased by ten fold!
What Can You Do To Protect Bears?

Dispose of all garbage or food scraps in bear proof garbage containers or take it with you.

Do not feed wildlife. Feeding a bear guarantees its demise!

Do not approach within 50 yards or any distance that disturbs a bear.

Do not allow bears to approach you (See ""What Do I Do If I See A Bear?"" above).

Use the food storage cables to store your food and garbage when camping in the backcountry.

If you see another visitor breaking these rules, or encounter a bear in a picnic area or campground, on a trail, or in any other developed area, please call (865) 436-1230 or stop at a Visitor Center to report it.

Other Threats to Bears

Non-Native Species: The European wild hog is one of the most direct threats to the black bear. These pervasive intruders feed on the acorns and other foods that are mainstays of bear diets. Another non-native species, the gypsy moth, is expanding its range toward the park. This insect defoliates oak trees, weakening them and leaving them susceptible to other insects and diseases which may kill the trees. Not only could bear's food source of acorns be affected, but some of the prime denning spots in old growth trees may be lost.

Poaching: Unfortunately, the lure of high profits on international markets encourages the poaching of black bears. Several cultures believe that bear gall bladders, paws, and claws have medicinal powers or consider them gourmet delicacies.

Urban Encroachment: Community and private developments near park boundaries are causing a loss in habitat for the bears. Poaching activities can be somewhat curtailed, and bear populations can eventually rebound from the losses. But once the critical habitats are destroyed, major declines in bear populations are inevitable. In addition, bears that venture outside park boundaries into neighboring communities may encounter human food and become unpredictable, dangerous, and a threat to human safety.

HOT TUB COVER cost several hundreds of dollars do NOT stand on it sit on it sleep on it and do NOT let your kids play on it it will break it in and you will be charged for the cost I paid $430 for this cover.
Hot tub I cannot guarantee that the hot tub will be working for every guest. They do break down by agreeing to this you cannot leave me a bad review over a hot tub. I have no control over when they break down. It's only happened twice in two years it is rare but it can't happen.

Hot Tub Rules and Policies

For your safety and protection, please read these rules and precautions prior to using the hot tub.

When using the hot tub, basic safety precautions should always be observed including the following:
As a result of cleaning and servicing, hot tubs are sometimes not up to full temperature at the time of check in and may need several hours to heat. Please do not adjust the temperature of the water in the hot tub. The Maximum safe operating water temperature for a hot tub is 104 degrees Fahrenheit.  You may adjust the jets and lights as desired.
Do not use, or allow the hot tub to be used, alone. Do not permit children under the age of eighteen (18) to use the hot tub unless they are closely supervised at all times. Unsupervised use by children is strictly prohibited. In no case should children under the age of eight (8) be permitted in the hot tub. Never leave children unattended in the vicinity of the hot tub.
Pregnant women and individuals under medical care (for such problems as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, skin sensitivities, cardiac or circulatory problems) should consult their physician prior to using the hot tub. Never use the hot tub when taking anticoagulants, antihistamines, vasoconstrictors, vasodilators, stimulants, narcotics or tranquilizers. In all cases, if you are not thoroughly familiar with the medication(s) that you are taking, please consult with your physician prior to using the hot tub.
Guest(s) with skin, ear, genital or other body infections, skin sores, or open wounds are not allowed to use the hot tub due to the possibility of spreading infection.
It is recommended that guest(s) shower before and after using the hot tub. Showering before use removes any lotions, deodorants, creams and/or common skin bacteria which reduce the effectiveness of the sanitizing chemicals used to disinfect the hot tub water. The hot tub is professionally cleaned and maintained; please do not add any chemicals.
Long hair should be restrained in a bathing cap or other restraining device. Never allow long hair to float in the hot tub. Suction through the drains and skimmers can be powerful. It is recommended that no jewelry is worn in the hot tub due to the chemicals used. The chemicals in hot tubs can also affect color-treated hair and damage swimsuits.
Always use caution when entering and exiting the hot tub. Surrounding patio/deck may be slippery and dangerous when wet.
Soaking for too long at high water temperatures can elevate body temperature and the temperature of internal organs beyond safe limits. Observe reasonable time limits to avoid nausea, dizziness and fainting. Should you experience any of these symptoms, carefully exit the hot tub immediately.
Alcoholic beverages should not be consumed before or during hot tub use. The temperature of the water may intensify the effects of alcohol and cause drowsiness, dizziness and/or unconsciousness.
Never use glass near or in the hot tub as broken glass can be a risk to a guest(s) which are barefoot and is very difficult to see within the hot tub.
Never walk, climb, play or jump on the cover of the hot tub. Never swim or play under the cover when it is installed on the hot tub. Also, do not rely on the cover as a way of keeping children out of the hot tub. Children must be supervised when they are in or around the hot tub. No diving or jumping into the hot tub.
Do not add anything to the water including foaming bubbles, chemicals, soaps, bath oils, etc. If these items are used in the hot tubs, an additional cleaning fee will be assessed.
Absolutely no candles (floating or any type) are allowed on or in the hot tub.
Absolutely no shoes are to be worn in the hot tub.
Absolutely no electrical appliances should be used in or near the hot tub.
When the hot tub is not in use, the cover must be reinstalled in the proper position and secured, especially if there are any children in the vicinity. Hot tub covers are easily damaged. Guest(s) agree(s) to inspect the hot tub cover for any damage upon arrival and report any problems to the owners immediately.
Please do not turn off or unplug the hot tub. This can interfere with maintaining the cleanliness and temperature of the unit.
Guest(s) agrees to leave the hot tub in the same condition it was received. If cleaning and/or repairs are required due to negligence or abuse, guest(s) will be required to pay for the cleaning and/or repairs.
Guest(s) understands there will be no reduction in rental fees if the hot tub is unused or unavailable during the term of Lessee's rental period.
The owners of Michael Ryion accept no responsibility for the use of this hot tub by any guest(s).


Traveler insurance

Whether you need to travel interstate, overseas or to another city for business or for personal reasons, any trip away from your home involves planning, expense and some risk.

Travel insurance can cover you for financial losses caused by a wide range of events that can affect your trip, whether they occur before, during or even after your trip. These might include travel modification, cancellation or interruption, medical expenses, baggage damage or theft, and more.

Travel insurance should be a priority in all travel arrangements, whether you travel regularly, occasionally or you are setting off on a once-in-a-lifetime trip.

For international journeys, the Australian Government advises that travel insurance is as important as a passport, regardless of your destination.

You should purchase a travel insurance policy as soon as you have paid for you trip. That way you may be covered for unused travel and accommodation in the event that you must cancel your trip due to a covered event, such as illness or a natural disaster.

Most travel insurers offer policies that cover families and couples, and some also offer multi-trip and annual policies for frequent travellers.",I do like to socialize so you're more than welcome to text me or call,,The best way to get around his by Vehicle.

Romantically nestled in the woods, this authentic log cabin is located half way between Gatlinburg (6mi) & Pigeon Forge (5mi) this studio cabin has a full kitchen, wood burning fireplace, jacuzzi tub, private outdoor jacuzzi, luxurious king bed and roku TV. Escape to your own slice of rustic paradise, surrounded by the stunning tranquility of the Great Smoky MountainsThe space“Mountaintop Romance” is designed as a romantic and cozy getaway for couples young and old. Relax, unwind and make lasting memories with the one you love!  You can enjoy apparent seclusion all while being with 15 mins of the main attractions in both Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The cabin is located at the top of persimmon mountain at the end of a private road with only 4 other small cabins. Smell the flowers, listen to the birds chirp and enjoy a strong chance to witness the magic of a momma bear and her cubs wondering the area. We are also easy to get to on back roads which can be very handy as a way to avoid the bumper to bumper traffic on the parkway.The cabin is located on top of a private road. We are in a very limited signal area and rely on Viperbroadband for WiFI and Roku TV streaming. WIFI can be spotty and is slower than off the mountain. If you do plan to work or are in need of phone service at all times while in the cabin it would be wise to book elsewhere. Mountaintop Romance is for those wanting to unplug and enjoy the mountains.  Cellular service can be iffy so it is recommended you connect to WiFi calling once you reach the cabin. We are a true mountain log cabin and the majority of cabins in the area do not provide internet but we are providing the best available for us at this time. **NOTE: the last 1/4 mile to the cabin is on a gravel road, there is a curve which does require a three point turn half way up (please see pictures in listing for images of the road and sharp left turn). The vast majority of our guests have no issues at all with the driveway and to us it is part of the mountain experience, however if you are uncomfortable with driving on an inclined gravel road this is not the cabin for you. If you are looking for a true couples' mountain getaway we cannot wait to host you!Guest accessKeypad code given to guests for easy and convenient self check in",,,,,,,,,"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-598548785457445412/original/f42ded6d-ee2b-46a2-935f-3648559ca877.jpeg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-598548785457445412/original/708e80e5-75c6-4e55-8e7e-21d7a458c59f.jpeg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-598548785457445412/original/0f86d444-8593-4253-ac8f-f663234d96af.jpeg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-598548785457445412/original/c331d5d9-8da4-4ab8-9d6e-a63b7de520c2.jpeg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-598548785457445412/original/89cd5fda-6608-4957-9d56-a047acdb39a2.jpeg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-598548785457445412/original/fe6605b2-3cbc-456f-9332-36c5e4e7cd7f.jpeg?im_w=720"

Pet friendly cabin!  Bring up to 2 dogs with you during your stay.  Dogs must be kept with you or in a kennel when you leave the cabin.  No additional fee for your furry friend.**Perfect for both a romantic getaway and a weekend away with the family, Cozy Bear Lodge is the perfect Smoky Mountain cabin for a TRUE mountain experience.  It's a very large 1 BR (sleeps 6) with wifi, a hot tub and tons of space.The spaceCozy Bear Lodge is central between Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge and just 6 miles away from the action.  But it FEELS isolated, being in the middle of the woods and hills.The cabin is located deep in the woods, down a beautiful and winding mountain road.   It's located directly between Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, so it's right where you want to be.  Getting there, you even cross a small creek and pond...  It's perfect for having your ""cabin"" experience in the Smoky Mountains! You can take in the birds and trees from rockers on both the front and back porches, soak in the hot tub after a long day hiking/shopping, or relax with the TV and pool table or even play a game on the arcade  (Netflix, Disney+ and YouTube TV are all logged in and ready to go).The cabin itself is appointed just as you'd hope and is huge for a 1 bedroom (1386 sf) so you never feel cramped for space.  Upstairs is the open living area with soaring ceilings and plenty of windows to let the light in.  A sleeper sofa and comfy chair frame the gas fireplace so everyone can stay warm on those cold evenings.  Also, the kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need - Keurig and a coffee maker, pots, pans, silverware, glasses, blender, crock pot, microwave, iron and board, washer and dryer. Just bring any food you want and you're all set.There is a 4 burner propane bbq grill on the porch with all the tools you need to grill up a tasty meal, if that's your preference.  (Propane take will be there but you may need to swap it out)The two flat screen TVs have Netflix/YouTube TV/Disney+ hooked up and of course there is wifi so you stay connected.  (But ONLY if you want to!)The bedroom features a king bed with extra comfy mattress, which is perfect for getting a great night of sleep.  If you're feeling in the mood (hint-hint guys looking for brownie points), an in-room Jacuzzi tub is perfect for that.   (There is a full shower+bath here too!) We recently added a second sleeper sofa and table to the room just in case you either want to relax or bring along an extra person or two.  On the outside, there's a private hot tub on the porch to warm your muscles and help you relax after a long day exploring the area.  Keep your eyes open because if you're lucky, every week or two guests spot a black bear (Dolly) and her cubs walking by!! When you're done relaxing in the hills, the entire area is chock full of things to see and do. Head to Great Smoky Mountains National Park for a long hike and your eyes peeled for wildflowers, white-tailed deer and 60+ species of birds that are there year round. If it happens to be rainy, climb into your car and take a drive through the park for glimpses of historic buildings dating back to the 1800s. In either case, pack a picnic lunch and make a day of it!Dollywood is the beating heart in the area and has something for all ages, whether it be amusement park rides or fun live entertainment. Gatlinburg Golf Course is there if you have a desire to get in a few holes... But most don't know that there is a Harrah's Casino a short drive away in Cherokee, NC. And of course you can ski at Ober in Gatlinburg as well as Cataloochee Ski Area in North Carolina if you want to get some half decent shredding action.**  I want to note that if there is snow/ice on the ground, you will want a 4WD vehicle.  The Smoky Mountains are very hilly and the cabin is on a hill too.  I'm not aware of any wrecks due to weather but I definitely want you to be safe! **Also, our team will be following all CDC guidelines on cleaning & using EPA registered products to thoroughly clean & disinfect so you can feel more comfortable staying at our cabin.For a couple seeking a relaxing and romantic retreat or a small family looking for a getaway, there's no better place than here in the Smoky Mountains.

Our cabin features:✔ High-Speed Wi-Fi✔ Hot Tub✔ Arcade✔ Washer/Dryer✔ Free Private ParkingOther things to note***  The entire Smoky Mountain area is very hilly (After all, it IS the Smoky Mountains!) so do yourself a favor and download an ""offline map"" in your Goo gle Maps program.

Owner Information:  I can be contacted via text or phone anytime before, during, or after your stay via Airbnb or 847/894-3239.YOU AGREE TO AND/OR ACKNOWLEDGE THE FOLLOWING IF BOOKING THIS CABIN:Strict Extra Guest Fee:  I price my Cabins for couples!  There is a $25 per person per night extra guest fee which I’m very strict on.  If more than two people (including children over the age of 2) are traveling in your party, you must indicate such when booking.  More than two people cause more wear and tear on amenities and Cabin mechanicals.  Please consider another Cabin if the extra person fee puts a strain on your vacation budget.  Thank you.Pets/Animals: I do NOT permit pets or animals of any kind for any reason.  My housekeeper has SEVERE respiratory allergies. Hot Tub Cleaning: The Hot Tub is drained and refilled after each guest.  Therefore, depending on when the hot tub was filled, it might be cool upon your arrival.  The hot tub does take several hours to reach max temperature.  This should be kept in mind if booking for only one night.  Keeping the lid on will heat the hot tub faster.  Any body of water has a potential for drowning.  It is slippery in and around the hot tub.  Use at your own risk.  Children are not allowed in the hot tub.Heating & AC: The Cabin has a residential system in it like any other home.  It is not a commercial system.  I ask the AC be set no lower than 68 degrees and the heat no higher than 74.  Additionally, the AC cannot be run before, during,  or after fireplace use.  If you like it cooler, warmer, or like to run the AC with the fireplace, I kindly request you choose another Cabin.  Fireplace: For obvious reasons, the fireplace is non-operational during warm weather months.  The fireplace is operational October 15th through March 15th.  Again, the AC cannot be run before, during,  or after fireplace use.Cell Service: My Verizon cell service works ""ok"" for calling or texting.  Data usage is not the best but the Cabin Wifi works great.Mountain Roads: This Cabin is on a mountain in the Sky Harbor subdivision.  It is easily accessed via asphalt roads.  There are sharp turns and steep grades, which might be a shock to some.  Please take your time driving.  Some roads require you to pull over so another car can safely pass.  Don't panic, our fully loaded Honda Odyssey mini-van and Honda Civic get to the cabin with no problems under dry and rainy conditions.With that being said, in the event of snow, going up or down the mountain is not recommended.  This area averages 10 inches of snow per year.No Smoking: There is no smoking or vaping of any kind permitted in the Cabin!!Grill Charcoal: Unfortunately, I do not guarantee a supply of charcoal at this time.  Please plan accordingly.Cleaning Supplies: There is a starter supply of dishwashing soap, garbage bags, and paper towels.  You will need to supply your own after the starter supply runs out.  Laundry detergent is not supplied.Check in Time: 4:00 PM (sometimes my housekeeper will have the Cabin ready sooner but there is no guarantee).Check Out Time: 10:00 AM.  The housekeeper arrives shortly after 10:00 A.M..Pest Control: The cabin is treated regularly for insects, mice, & scorpions.  However, you are on a mountain and at times they may make their way inside the cabin.  Keep all doors and windows closed at all times to prevent unwanted guests.**If you are making a reservation on or around October 15th; you are agreeing to permit a service technician to enter the Cabin to start fireplace service for the season.  I try to do this in between guests but the schedule sometimes does not work out.Guest accessHaving a vehicle is a necessity.  However, Uber is available in the area.  You will have access to all living spaces of the Cabin.Other things to noteI have a strict no refund policy.  As in any home, sometimes things break.  There will be no refunds for any reason to include power outages, cable outages, malfunctioning TV's, fireplace, hot tub, appliances, etc..  If you encounter any problems, please contact me right away.  I will attempt to rectify the issue as soon as is reasonable based on availability of the required technician.Refunds will not be given for cancellations; no matter the reason.",,,"No smoking or vaping is permitted in the Cabin.
No Pets or Animals of any kind are permitted at the Cabin.  My housekeeper has very severe allergies which affect the respiratory system.
I take great pride in my Cabins. As a result, I provide a rental agreement guests must sign in order to gain access to the Cabin. I supply this rental agreement through email. I also require a copy of a government issued ID even if you have one on file with Airbnb.",I can be reached by phone 24 hours a day. I can be reached by text message for a majority of the day.,,There is parking for two vehicles at the Cabin. You will need to have your own transportation to get around the area. Note: Snowy conditions may make travel up or down the mountain very difficult and/or impossible. The subdivision does remove snow but it might not be as efficient as areas you live in.,,,"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-47980141/original/c2984d59-2b9c-42c0-a1d0-ad495aaadb22.jpeg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-47980141/original/92ebbf7e-030c-411e-a2ac-63355352a01c.jpeg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-47980141/original/b6eedab5-4551-4a86-8860-1a73d7a0c25d.jpeg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-47980141/original/47241e47-09c2-4ea8-820e-566337cf14bf.jpeg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-47980141/original/7f0f46f0-48b7-48e5-9654-8cdb3232e207.jpeg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/75682049-192f-4dcd-bace-af41d954593b.jpg?im_w=720"

But because the 1-bedroom cabin includes a sofa that converts into a queen-size bed, it’s also a delightful, conveniently located option for a family of up to 4. Located in the quiet Hemlock Hills community in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, Magic Moments II was designed with relaxation and romance in mind. Wood-planked walls and floors, a sloped ceiling, and a stacked-stone fireplace make the living room a place for stretching out and taking it easy. Whether you sprawl out on the plush sofa to watch a movie on the large flat-panel TV, nestle in the armchair with that book you never have time to read at home, or treat yourself to a nap beneath the gentle breeze of the ceiling fan, you’ll feel blissfully removed from the everyday.  The breakfast bar, which seats 2, is a handy spot for surfing the web via the free WiFi. Or one of you can perch there mixing batter while the other heats up the pan for whipping up a batch of pancakes in the fully equipped kitchen. While there are plenty of restaurants to choose from just minutes away, sometimes it’s more restful—and romantic—to dine in. That’s why the kitchen has all the appliances, gadgets, cookware, and tableware you’ll need, whether you’re preparing a gourmet feast or simply mixing margaritas to enjoy out on the deck. You’ll find a grill outside too, so you can enjoy a home-cooked Smoky Mountain barbecue. You might find yourself spending much of your time on the spacious covered deck or in the yard. When you’re not enjoying a sunny picnic on the well-manicured lawn, you can kick back on a deck rocker and watch the trees sway in the mountain breeze as birds chirp and trill. Or you can laze in the deck’s hot tub; it’s especially rejuvenating when you return from a day on the slopes or the hiking trail. Back indoors, you’ll love luxuriating in the en-suite bedroom. Here’s where you’ll find the large heart-shape jetted tub, along with a 2nd stone-surround fireplace. While the warming fire bathes the room in a golden glow you can watch a movie on the bedroom’s flat-screen TV or listen to the crickets serenade you from outside the window. From the tub it’s just a few steps to the king-size bed. You might find yourself turning in early and staying in bed late, simply to revel in the bedroom’s cocoon of luxury. Whether it’s just the 2 of you or you brought the kids along (don’t forget about that queen-size sleeper sofa in the living room), you’re sure to enjoy the cabin’s full-size pool table. If you’ve never played before, here’s your chance to learn—and then you can surprise your friends when you return home! For all its serenity, Magic Moments II is conveniently close to all the area’s major attractions. In less than 15 minutes you can drive to downtown Gatlinburg, where you’ll find plenty of restaurants, shops, thrill rides, and attractions (Ripley’s Aquarium of the Smokies, anyone?) to keep you busy. The cabin is just as close to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, home to waterfalls, hiking trails, historic cabins, and some of the highest ridges of the Appalachian range. And let’s not forget the Gatlinburg Arts and Crafts Loop, Dollywood, miniature golf, skiing, white-water rafting… Once you stay in Magic Moments II you’ll want to return again and again—it really is that magical.

Perhaps this might work for you, too.Other things to noteThere is a new cabin being built up the hill, so there may be some construction noise at times.",,,"Things to note:

Roads are steep and narrow! 

Must be 21+ to book. No exceptions.

Cell service can be spotty, depending on your carrier. Make sure you write down the door code that you will receive seven days in advance, in case your phone isn’t working in the driveway. (If your cell coverage is weak, consider using Wifi to make your calls.)

Keep car doors locked at all times and do not leave any food or sweet-smelling items in your car due to curious bears. 

Gas fireplace is turned off between April 1 and October 1. 

Please make sure you rinse off before using the hot tub as oils and lotions can damage the tub and dirty the water.

Ring security camera located on front deck pointing at the driveway.

If you bring more people than agreed upon by your reservation you will be asked to leave without a refund and/or charged an extra $50 per person per night.

Please note the cabin is in the woods adjacent to a national forest/park where wildlife, including bugs are allowed to thrive and are to be expected. We have seen bears, wild turkey, bobcats, raccoons and other creatures. The cabin is sprayed on a regular basis but you may encounter harmless insects. No refunds are given for bugs.

- The hot tub is all ready for you and should be set no lower than 95 or more than 104 degrees at all times

Not only does the gas fireplace, set in rustic stone, warm up the cabin on chilly evenings, but it also bathes the wood-planked walls and beamed ceiling in a romantic glow.Views for days of Mt LeConte, the snow at Ober Gatlinburg and the lights of Pigeon Forge. Only 10 minutes to Gatlinburg proper or 15 to Pigeon Forge. Hiking close by in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.The spaceYou and your sweetheart can while away the hours luxuriating in the outdoor hot tub or the indoor Jacuzzi, snuggling in front of the fireplace, and sipping drinks on the deck swing beneath the star-studded sky.  And when you want a change of scenery, you can head to action-packed downtown Gatlinburg; it’s only ten minutes away.Perched atop a ridge and nestled among towering trees, the cabin offers exceptional privacy. The only sounds you’re likely to hear are singing wrens and warblers in the day and serenading whip-poor-wills and tree frogs at night. A table for two on the front lawn allows you to enjoy your meals out among the birdsong and the fresh mountain breezes. Or kick back on one of the back porch’s rockers with a frosty drink—relaxation is practically guaranteed. The porch’s swing is ideal for both of you to snuggle amid the silvery sheen of the moonlight, listening to owls hooting in the woods. And for the ultimate in alfresco luxury, there’s the deck’s hot tub. After a day of hiking, skiing, or biking, a long soak will have your tired muscles feeling as good as new.The cabin has a jetted tub indoors as well, in the spacious bedroom. The tub is designed for two, so you can enjoy the massaging jets of steamy water with your sweetie before climbing into the king-size bed. The lustrous wood-planked walls, the vaulted ceiling, and the rustic furnishings definitely add to the romantic ambience. All that’s left is to play your favorite music on the cabin’s CD player.The living area has the same elevated woodsy vibe. The stone-surround gas fireplace bathes the wood walls and cathedral ceiling in a golden glow on chilly winter evenings. Sprawl out on the plush sofa to watch a movie on the flat-screen TV with cable or settle back in an armchair to surf the web via the free WiFi.The open kitchen includes all your major appliances and plenty of minor ones as well, such as a coffeemaker, a toaster, and a blender (did someone say margaritas?). There’s a full array of cookware and tableware too, plus a charcoal grill outside. When you don’t want to eat outdoors, you can do so at the restaurant-style booth just off the kitchen, outfitted with a table, benches, and even lace curtains. After dinner, shoot some pool in the game room—no need to head to town for your evening entertainment.When you arrive at Shooting Star, you’ll find the bed beautifully made up and plenty of clean towels in the bathroom, which features a roomy shower. Among other conveniences, the cabin has its own washer and dryer.Guest accessYou get the entire cabin to yourself.Other things to noteThe road up to the cabin is very STEEP. The access road to this cabin is paved  but does have an incline. At times it narrows to one lane. There are a quite few twists and turns. It's about .3 miles of steepness. We can make it up in a Prius with no problem. This cabin is not for the less adventurous type. If you want flat roads this is not for you. If you want to be near the park with a breathtaking view and hiking nearby... look no further!Note the fireplace is only open beginning of October though end of March.Motorcycles and trailers are not recommended. 4-wheel drive is recommended for adverse winter conditions.

Small critters (bees, insects, spiders, raccoons, scorpions) and large critters (bears) will come in if they have a way to get there.  Please note that the cabin is in a wooded area.

You agree that the owners/hosts are not held responsible for any health conditions that arise from your use of the hot tub. Our housekeepers drain, sanitize, refill and replenish chemicals in all tubs prior to your arrival; therefore, it may not be warm until later that evening. DO NOT STAND ON THE HOT TUB COVERS. Hot tub covers are for insulation purposes and are not designed to support a person or persons. They will break and you may be charged for replacement.

The septic system is very effective; however, it will clog up if improper material is flushed. DO NOT FLUSH anything other than toilet paper. No feminine products should be flushed at any time.   If it is found that feminine products have been flushed and clog the septic system, you could be charged damages of $1,000 or more.

We do not provide refunds if you are unable to drive up to the cabin due to steepness or other road conditions. 

No alterations or changes are allowed after 48 hours of booking for any reason including (but not limited to): sickness, injury, scheduling conflicts, death, etc. If you decide to check-out early for any reason, you agree not to request or receive any refunds. If this is a concern for you, we encourage you to obtain travel insurance; note: some credit card companies provide travel insurance by default.

18.	Any damage to any items in the cabin including couches, chairs, tables, TVs, hot tub, beds, sheets, towels, pillows, etc, are the responsibility of the Guest. Every item will be looked at before arrival and after departure. If you or your pet(s) cause damage, notify the owner immediately. We will find it and charge you regardless. It is our home. Treat it as if it were your own.

19.  Guests shall hereby indemnify and hold harmless the Owner(s) against any and all claims of personal injury or property damage or loss arising from use of the premises and hot tub, regardless of the nature of the accident, injury or loss.

Warning: Bears are wild animals that are dangerous and unpredictable. Do not approach bears or allow them to approach you!
Willfully approaching within 50 yards (150 feet), or any distance that disturbs or displaces a bear, is illegal in the park.Violation of this federal regulation can result in fines and arrest. Use binoculars, telephoto lens, or a spotting scope to view the animals.
Check the ""Bear Closures"" and ""Bear Warnings"" section of the Temporary Closures page before planning a hike in the park.

Attacks on humans are rare. If you are physically attacked by a black bear, fight back aggressively with any available object--the bear may consider you as prey! Do not ""play dead."" Help protect others by reporting all bear incidents to a park ranger immediately. Keep your distance from bears.

What Do I Do If I See A Bear?
Bears in the park or at your cabin are wild and their behavior can be unpredictable. Although extremely rare, attacks on humans have occurred, inflicting serious injuries and death. Treat bear encounters with extreme caution! Learn what to do if you see a bear by watching this short video.
If you see a bear:

Remain watchful.

Do not approach it

Do not allow the bear to approach you.

If your presence causes the bear to change its behavior (stops feeding, changes its travel direction, watches you, etc.) you are too close.

Being too close may promote aggressive behavior from the bear such as running toward you, making loud noises, or swatting the ground. The bear is demanding more space. Don't run, but slowly back away, watching the bear. Increase the distance between you and the bear. The bear will probably do the same.

If a bear persistently follows or approaches you, without vocalizing, or paw swatting:

Change your direction.

If the bear continues to follow you, stand your ground.

If the bear gets closer, talk loudly or shout at it.

Act aggressively to intimidate the bear.

Act together as a group if you have companions. Make yourselves look as large as possible (for example, move to higher ground).

Throw non-food objects such as rocks at the bear.

Use a deterrent such as a stout stick.

Don't run and don't turn away from the bear.

Don't leave food for the bear; this encourages further problems.

If the bear's behavior indicates that it is after your food and you are physically attacked:

Separate yourself from the food.

Slowly back away.

If the bear shows no interest in your food and you are physically attacked, the bear may consider you as prey:

Fight back aggressively with any available object!

Do not play dead!

Help protect others, report all bear incidents to a park ranger immediately. Above all, keep your distance from bears! 

Stay safe in black bear country! Please watch this short video.

 Black bears are dangerous and unpredictable wild animals. Do not approach bears or allow them to approach you.

Bears in the Smokies
Great Smoky Mountains National Park is one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States where black bears can live in wild, natural surroundings.
Bears inhabit all elevations of the park. Though populations are variable, biologists estimate that roughly 1,500 bears live in the park. This equals a population density of approximately two bears per square mile. At one time, the black bear's range included most of North America except the extreme west coast. However loss of habitat has resulted in a significant reduction in this range.

Black bears in the Smokies are black in color, but in other parts of the country they may be brown or cinnamon. They may be six feet in length and up to three feet high at the shoulder. During the summer months, a typical adult male bear weighs approximately 250 pounds while adult females are generally smaller and weigh slightly over 100 pounds. However, bears may double their weight by the fall. Bears over 600 pounds have been documented in the park. Bears can live 12-15 years or more, however bears which have had access to human foods and garbage have a life expectancy of only half that time.

Bears, like humans, are omnivores. Plant materials such as berries and nuts make up approximately 85% of their diet. Insects and animal carrion provide valuable sources of protein for bears. 

Bears have color vision and a keen sense of smell. In addition, they are good tree climbers, can swim very well, and can run 30 miles per hour.

Bear Behavior
Bears are most active during early morning and late evening hours in spring and summer. Mating usually takes place in July. Both female and male bears may have more than one mate during the summer.

Bears choose a denning site with the coming of cold weather. Dens are usually hollow stumps, tree cavities, or wherever there is shelter. Bears in the Smokies are unusual in that they often den high above the ground in standing hollow trees. Bears do not truly hibernate, but enter long periods of sleep. They may leave the den for short periods if disturbed or during brief warming trends.

One to four cubs are born during the mother's winter sleep, usually in late January or early February. Bears weigh eight ounces at birth. Females with newly born cubs usually emerge from their winter dens in late March or early April. Commonly born in pairs, the cubs will remain with the mother for about eighteen months or until she mates again.
 
The park has replaced garbage cans with bear proof dumpsters to prevent bears from gaining access to garbage.

Garbage Kills Bears!
The bear's keen sense of smell leads it to insects, nuts and berries, but the animal is also enticed by the tantalizing smells of human food and garbage such as hot dogs, apple cores, chips, and watermelon rinds left on the ground in picnic areas, campgrounds, and along trails. Feeding bears or allowing them access to human food and garbage causes a number of problems:

It changes the bear's behavior and causes them to lose their instinctive fear of humans. Over time, these bears may begin approaching people in search of food and may become more unpredictable and dangerous.

Bears that obtain human food and garbage damage property and injure people. These bears pose a risk to public safety. They can also teach other bears this dangerous behavior. Often, they must be euthanized.

Studies have shown that bears that lose their fear of people by obtaining human food and garbage never live as long as bears that feed on natural foods and are shy and afraid of people. Many are hit by cars and become easy targets for poachers.

For these reasons, park rangers issue citations for littering, feeding bears, and for improper food storage. These citations can result in fines of up to $5,000 and jail sentences lasting up to six months. Visitors are urged to view all wildlife at a safe distance and to never throw food or garbage on the ground or leave it unattended. Garbage Kills Bears!
 
Help keep the bears wild. Do not feed bears. Remember, a fed bear is a dead bear!

Bear management is really people management. How visitors behave while in the park has an impact on the safety of bears. If you are careless with your food or litter, YOU may be responsible for a bear's death!
The park has done many things to make it easier for you to protect bears. Bear proof dumpsters or trash cans can be found in all campgrounds and picnic areas. Please use them to dispose of garbage.
During summer months, some of the busiest picnic areas close at 8:00 PM so these areas can be thoroughly cleaned before dark and any food scraps or trash left by careless visitors can be removed. Park rangers patrol picnic areas and campgrounds to enforce evening closures, littering and food storage regulations. They also strictly enforce regulations that prohibit approaching, harassing, disturbing or feeding bears.
An army of park volunteers patrol the park's most popular trails, picnic areas, and campgrounds to educate visitors about protecting bears. They confiscate unattended food or coolers and clean up food scraps left behind by careless visitors. These volunteers also assist in managing people during roadside bear jams.
In the backcountry, food storage cables have been installed to make it easier for backpackers to hang their food and garbage so that bears cannot get to it. At some campsites, telephone poles were flown into remote backcountry areas because the trees around the campsites were too small to set up an effective cable system!
The park's Resource Education staff provides information about bears at visitor centers, in the park's newspaper, and at evening programs. Educational signs about bears can be found on picnic tables throughout the park and bear safety videos are posted on this website.
Wildlife managers actively monitor for bear activity and use innovative and proactive techniques to keep bears shy, secretive, and afraid of people. This approach allows bears to remain in their home range, and discourages them from visiting developed areas or approaching people.
Results of these efforts are very encouraging. In some areas the number of bears that have to be trapped and moved away has decreased by ten fold!
What Can You Do To Protect Bears?

Dispose of all garbage or food scraps in bear proof garbage containers or take it with you.

Do not feed wildlife. Feeding a bear guarantees its demise!

Do not approach within 50 yards or any distance that disturbs a bear.

Do not allow bears to approach you (See ""What Do I Do If I See A Bear?"" above).

Use the food storage cables to store your food and garbage when camping in the backcountry.

If you see another visitor breaking these rules, or encounter a bear in a picnic area or campground, on a trail, or in any other developed area, please call (865) 436-1230 or stop at a Visitor Center to report it.

Other Threats to Bears

Non-Native Species: The European wild hog is one of the most direct threats to the black bear. These pervasive intruders feed on the acorns and other foods that are mainstays of bear diets. Another non-native species, the gypsy moth, is expanding its range toward the park. This insect defoliates oak trees, weakening them and leaving them susceptible to other insects and diseases which may kill the trees. Not only could bear's food source of acorns be affected, but some of the prime denning spots in old growth trees may be lost.

Poaching: Unfortunately, the lure of high profits on international markets encourages the poaching of black bears. Several cultures believe that bear gall bladders, paws, and claws have medicinal powers or consider them gourmet delicacies.

Urban Encroachment: Community and private developments near park boundaries are causing a loss in habitat for the bears. Poaching activities can be somewhat curtailed, and bear populations can eventually rebound from the losses. But once the critical habitats are destroyed, major declines in bear populations are inevitable. In addition, bears that venture outside park boundaries into neighboring communities may encounter human food and become unpredictable, dangerous, and a threat to human safety.

Hot tub cover cost several hundreds of dollars do not stand on it sit on it sleep on it and do not let your kids play on it it will break it in and you will be charged for the cost.
Hot tub I cannot guarantee that the hot tub will be working for every guest. They do break down by agreeing to this you cannot leave me a bad review over a hot tub. I have no control over when they break down. It's only happened twice in two years it is rare but it can't happen.

Hot Tub Rules and Policies

For your safety and protection, please read these rules and precautions prior to using the hot tub.

When using the hot tub, basic safety precautions should always be observed including the following:
As a result of cleaning and servicing, hot tubs are sometimes not up to full temperature at the time of check in and may need several hours to heat. Please do not adjust the temperature of the water in the hot tub. The Maximum safe operating water temperature for a hot tub is 104 degrees Fahrenheit.  You may adjust the jets and lights as desired.
Do not use, or allow the hot tub to be used, alone. Do not permit children under the age of eighteen (18) to use the hot tub unless they are closely supervised at all times. Unsupervised use by children is strictly prohibited. In no case should children under the age of eight (8) be permitted in the hot tub. Never leave children unattended in the vicinity of the hot tub.
Pregnant women and individuals under medical care (for such problems as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, skin sensitivities, cardiac or circulatory problems) should consult their physician prior to using the hot tub. Never use the hot tub when taking anticoagulants, antihistamines, vasoconstrictors, vasodilators, stimulants, narcotics or tranquilizers. In all cases, if you are not thoroughly familiar with the medication(s) that you are taking, please consult with your physician prior to using the hot tub.
Guest(s) with skin, ear, genital or other body infections, skin sores, or open wounds are not allowed to use the hot tub due to the possibility of spreading infection.
It is recommended that guest(s) shower before and after using the hot tub. Showering before use removes any lotions, deodorants, creams and/or common skin bacteria which reduce the effectiveness of the sanitizing chemicals used to disinfect the hot tub water. The hot tub is professionally cleaned and maintained; please do not add any chemicals.
Long hair should be restrained in a bathing cap or other restraining device. Never allow long hair to float in the hot tub. Suction through the drains and skimmers can be powerful. It is recommended that no jewelry is worn in the hot tub due to the chemicals used. The chemicals in hot tubs can also affect color-treated hair and damage swimsuits.
Always use caution when entering and exiting the hot tub. Surrounding patio/deck may be slippery and dangerous when wet.
Soaking for too long at high water temperatures can elevate body temperature and the temperature of internal organs beyond safe limits. Observe reasonable time limits to avoid nausea, dizziness and fainting. Should you experience any of these symptoms, carefully exit the hot tub immediately.
Alcoholic beverages should not be consumed before or during hot tub use. The temperature of the water may intensify the effects of alcohol and cause drowsiness, dizziness and/or unconsciousness.
Never use glass near or in the hot tub as broken glass can be a risk to a guest(s) which are barefoot and is very difficult to see within the hot tub.
Never walk, climb, play or jump on the cover of the hot tub. Never swim or play under the cover when it is installed on the hot tub. Also, do not rely on the cover as a way of keeping children out of the hot tub. Children must be supervised when they are in or around the hot tub. No diving or jumping into the hot tub.
Do not add anything to the water including foaming bubbles, chemicals, soaps, bath oils, etc. If these items are used in the hot tubs, an additional cleaning fee will be assessed.
Absolutely no candles (floating or any type) are allowed on or in the hot tub.
Absolutely no shoes are to be worn in the hot tub.
Absolutely no electrical appliances should be used in or near the hot tub.
When the hot tub is not in use, the cover must be reinstalled in the proper position and secured, especially if there are any children in the vicinity. Hot tub covers are easily damaged. Guest(s) agree(s) to inspect the hot tub cover for any damage upon arrival and report any problems to the owners immediately.
Please do not turn off or unplug the hot tub. This can interfere with maintaining the cleanliness and temperature of the unit.
Guest(s) agrees to leave the hot tub in the same condition it was received. If cleaning and/or repairs are required due to negligence or abuse, guest(s) will be required to pay for the cleaning and/or repairs.
Guest(s) understands there will be no reduction in rental fees if the hot tub is unused or unavailable during the term of Lessee's rental period.
The owners of Michael Ryion accept no responsibility for the use of this hot tub by any guest(s).

TRAVEL insurance

Whether you need to travel interstate, overseas or to another city for business or for personal reasons, any trip away from your home involves planning, expense and some risk.

Travel insurance can cover you for financial losses caused by a wide range of events that can affect your trip, whether they occur before, during or even after your trip. These might include travel modification, cancellation or interruption, medical expenses, baggage damage or theft, and more.

Travel insurance should be a priority in all travel arrangements, whether you travel regularly, occasionally or you are setting off on a once-in-a-lifetime trip.


You should purchase a travel insurance policy as soon as you have paid for you trip. That way you may be covered for unused travel and accommodation in the event that you must cancel your trip due to a covered event, such as illness or a natural disaster.

Most travel insurers offer policies that cover families and couples, and some also offer multi-trip and annual policies for frequent travellers.","I love meeting new people but I understand you will be exhausted when you arrive.

Both located in the beautiful Sherwood Forest Resort, minutes from GSMNP, Dollywood, The Islands, Ziplining,  Gatlinburg, Alpine Coaster and dozens of other attractions. The cabin featues an open concept blessed with sunlight, 1 gas/1 electric fireplace, cable, high speed internet, pool table, 60 game arcade, hot tub, outdoor pool, jacuzzi, washer/dryer, and a fully equipped kitchen & dining area.The spaceI hope you'll find this cabin as special to you as it is to us. From the moment we saw it, we fell in love with it. From the open floor plan that basks in sunlight, to the views from the deck, you'll fall in love with it the moment you enter. We sleep comfortably in the King bed and my little guys use the King or sleeper sofa. We play pool and video games late nights while mom relaxes in the jetted tub in the master bedroom. Cold nights are especially nice by the gas fireplace. From there we run to the heated hot tub on the deck. My wife and I are continually updating the unit. We just purchased a new dining room set and arcade console  in December with more updates to follow. I hope you enjoy the cabin as much as we do and you'll stay with us in the future. Please be aware that the gas bbq on the deck has been replaced with an inground heavy duty charcoal bbq in front of cabin for safety reasons.Guest accessGuests have use of the entire cabin with the exception of the owners closet which is locked. Guests may use the resort pool June through August. Be advised there is no lifeguards present so please supervise little ones closely.Other things to note- My property manager manages many properties. With that being said, I have to keep tightly to the arrival and departure times to avoid conflicts for the next guests arriving. - Single night bookings are permitted only if the day before and after are booked. - Please note that you are in a gated resort community with cabins spaced about 50 feet apart. If seclusion is what you desire, you may want to stay elsewhere- We are pet free as too many guests are allergic( Sorry to my furry friends)- Cell service can be tricky in the mountains. Please insert the cabin address, and your door/resort gate code in a note on your phone when I send them- We cater to honeymooners or couples looking for an intimate getaway and small groups of families and friends looking for quality family time together...- Beds/Baths: One King Bed upstairs with jacuzzi and attached bathroom with walk in shower. One Kind Bed downstairs with tub/shower just outside bedroom- We are beautifully decorated for Christmas and seasons- Due to sometimes inclement weather in the winter, we recommend travel insurance, which we do have a source for obtaining.- REPAIRS & SERVICE CALLS: We take pride in maintaining our cabin & perform regular maintenance to keep everything in good working order. It is impossible, however, to guarantee that all appliances, hot tub, fireplaces, etc., will be in working order 100% of the time. We will, however, make every effort to correct any problem you encounter during your stay as soon as possible. Non-emergency maintenance issues will be handled during normal business hours. If you need emergency assistance for any reason, please contact me immediately. I'm available for guests 24 hours/day.  While we will make every attempt to correct all issues as quickly as possible, no refunds will be made for mechanical failures of hot tub, appliances/electronics, or interruption/loss of utilities (including satellite TV), etc. Any and all repairs to be made during your stay have to be approved by the guest before I allow a repair person in, unless the repair is of urgent circumstances, ie. water leaks, structural issues, and /or dangerous situations. Thank you so very much for your understanding.",,,"Garbage must be placed in pails in front of cabin and dishes must be washed prior to departure. Guests failing to do so will be charged $50.00. The cabin has beautiful mountain views, but with that being said, they can be dangerous for children. The rear deck deck is no less than 50 feet above the ground and the fall would be fatal. Rest assured the deck is safe as I had a contractor add additional supporting structures under the hot tub area when I purchased the cabin. Children can drown in the hot tub, so they must always be supervised. The cover must always be on the hot tub when not in use. There is no gate on the deck, so if a child is on the porch, they can walk freely to the front of the cabin where guest traffic passes. Please, please watch little ones carefully.","I'm available to my guests by phone, text or email. I prefer a phone call/text upon arrival to ensure you've arrived safely and the cabin is in acceptable condition. You will forfeit your booking if the guest and owner do not speak within 48 hours of booking. Please call me if I do not get to call you. This is just to ensure that the guest and the rental property are a good fit.",,"Please make sure you have a vehicle for transportation. If your flying in, I can refer you to numerous car rentals. Although the cabin is close to the attractions, you'll still need a vehicle to access them all. There is a trolly to get you into downtown Gatlinburg, just understand no matter what you drive, when the ""Parkway"" gets busy, everybody slows down. It may be busy, but it's only because there's so much to do and so many people wanting to do it like yourself.",,,"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6e8820f9-2cfa-46c7-aaf5-b431700c1861.jpg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/85688dd0-4af1-4302-920d-0c290c701422.jpg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c72eeadd-918e-46d7-8013-614cbc1cff44.jpg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a7fe7600-2a71-4031-ba66-172b05b4368f.jpg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ce546950-035d-4006-8fe7-e14f9e22d397.jpg?im_w=720,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3481a393-8ce1-47c5-9e01-b1b984e56de5.jpg?im_w=720"

The premise is a vacation rental. The rights and obligations of the parties to this agreement include unique provisions permitting the disbursement of rent prior to tenancy and expediting eviction of tenants. Your signature to this agreement, or payment of money or taking possession of the property is evidence of your acceptance of the agreement and your intent to use this property for a vacation rental. 

ARRIVAL/DEPARTURES: Check in time is 4:00 PM Eastern Time or later. Early check in is NOT available during holidays, the summer or the month of October. During non-peak seasons, your cabin may be ready earlier than 4:00 PM. We cannot guarantee an early check-in, but if it's available sooner than 4:00 we'll let you know. Check out time is by 10:00 AM Eastern Time. If you stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the host's consent, you might be charged an additional $50 per hour late fee. NO REFUNDS OR PARTIAL REFUNDS will be given for early departure or any other reasons, including inclement weather, construction, road conditions, or malfunctions in equipment (i.e. hot tubs, jacuzzi, fireplace, DVD players etc.). If you are traveling to the area during the winter season, we advise that you keep a check on the local weather. In order to help keep the cabin maintained for the next renter we ask that you adhere to the following rules: On the day of your check-out, please refer to the checklist provided in the rental information. We ask that you leave the house in good condition, thermostats set to the requested settings and ALL doors are locked. If these procedures are not followed an excessive cleaning fee will be charged.

Our chalet style, authentic Appalachian timber, log home sits on a .82 acre wooded lot, 2500 feet up on Cove Mountain and has no next door neighbors. All you see around you are beautiful views of the Great Smoky Mountains.The spaceSouthern Drawl Cabin offers over sixteen hundred square feet of living space, a great room with soaring cathedral ceilings,  a spacious kitchen with an island,  a main level bedroom with a queen size aspen log bed, and a loft bedroom with: a queen size bed, a queen size sofa sleeper, and an Arachnid dartboard console. There are two baths, one on the main level and one in the loft. All 3 TV's are supplied with Direct TV.As you arrive at the cabin, the first thing you will notice is its' expansive view of Cove Mountain. It still takes my breath away every time I walk out onto the deck! When you enter the cabin, you will be immediately greeted by the cathedral ceiling and 11 front windows that tower 2 stories in the Great Room. The windows provide an impressive and constant view of Cove Mountain and Wears Valley. When you seek a break from all of your Smoky Mountain adventures, you can sink into our new sofas (3/15/21) as you watch DIrect TV or a movie on our DVD player all while warming your toes in front of the toasty gas fireplace (available Oct-Mar). Our dining area has seating for four, and we have a fully equipped kitchen where you can prepare a home cooked meal. The rest of the main level has a bedroom and a bath. The bedroom has an aspen log queen bed, armoire and dresser. You can enjoy your favorite TV show from under the fluffy comforter as you settle in for the night. The main level bath has a full size washer and dryer, a shower with sliding glass doors, a pedestal sink and toilet. The stairs in the Great Room will lead you up to a spacious loft. A cabin isn't complete without a rustic chandelier and ours provides ambient lighting for the new sofa sleeper in the sitting area. Tucked away in the back corner is a queen size bed with another TV. The Loft also doubles as a game room. We have an Arachnid dartboard console along with storage cubes that are filled with crayons, coloring books, cards, DVD's and board games. The loft bathroom has a relaxing jetted tub where you can soak your cares away.Outside you will find ample parking in our driveway. Our new, 2 tier composite deck was just replaced in March 2021. Both decks offer beautiful views of Cove Mountain and the morning sunrise. The top deck, leads you around to our covered, outdoor, dining area and gas grill. There's nothing like flipping burgers out in the beauty of nature; it seems like less of a chore. The bottom deck offers a suspended porch swing, and will take you to the area of our enclosed hot tub. A perfect place for a relaxing soak! LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! Southern Drawl Cabin is located in the ""quiet side of the Smokys"" in Wears Valley. While we are away from the hustle and bustle of downtown; Cades Cove, Metcalf Bottoms, The Sinks, Meigs Falls, Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, Townsend, Dollywood and the Great Smoky National Park are within a 5-25 minute scenic drive away.WE DO NOT ALLOW PETSI am frequently asked, ""What is the drive up to the cabin like?"" Once you turn off of 321, it's about a 3 mile drive. The first 2 miles are relatively flat; with a gradual incline. The last mile has more of an incline and 3 steep but short inclines; at this point you know you are going up. The road itself is 1-1/2 to 2 lanes wide, paved and in excellent shape compared to many others that I've been on. 4 wheel drive is not necessary to get up the mountain (in normal driving conditions); it is a scenic, woodsy drive. The majority of people who live on the mountain are very courteous and will stop and pull off in a driveway to make the side by side passing of 2 larger vehicles easier. If you've never had the experience of driving up a mountain, the first time up you may feel a bit intimidated but like anything else, once you've done it and know where you are going and what to expect...it's a breeze and the view from the cabin will be worth it. My daughter now laughs at herself and how scared she was the first time she drove up alone. Common sense and normal driving skills will get you to the cabin. I have yet to have received any complaints from Guests saying that the drive up was too much for them and they had to make other accommodation plans.***WINTER SEASON GUESTS, just some things to consider. Winter is a beautiful time to come to the Smokys, but when it comes to the weather, it can also be unpredictable.  If there is snow in the forecast, you might want to have a few local hotels on speed dial, and you will have to be willing to adapt to possible changes in your plans. Snow & ice can make the road to the cabin dangerous and impassable; snow plows do not service mountain roads. Your safety is our #1 concern. If you can't get up the mountain to the cabin, please try to find alternate accommodations in town, and we will refund your nights' stay price accordingly. If you are ""stuck"" up at the cabin, stay put until it's safe to drive down, even if it's your day to check out. We will always work with our Guests during weather related issues and adjust pricing or issue refunds if snow or ice keep you from staying with us. If you are up at the cabin and snow is in the future forecast, think about having a decent supply of food on hand, just in case. Local restaurants will not deliver you food during a snow storm.Guest accessEverythingOther things to noteTennessee charges 12.75% in renters tax.

Other attractions up here in the Mountains are BEARS, BEES AND VARIOUS BUGSWELCOME TO THE GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS.  In addition to being the vacation capital of the United States. We are also home to the most varieties of bugs and pests.  Please see below a few of the most common ones.  Mosquitos are everywhere it is RECOMMEND to spray yourself every outing with repellent.  LADYBUG SEASON - Certain months out of the year ladybugs hatch in the thousands. They do not harm you and just don’t know what they are doing. They swarm around windows, doors, decks, and fly everywhere. They mate then die and you will overnight find bundles of them. Treatment is just to sweep them outside and off the decks. STINK BUG SEASON - Certain months out of the year ladybugs hatch in the thousands. They do not harm you and just don’t know what they are doing. They swarm around windows, doors, decks, and fly everywhere. They mate then die and you will overnight find bundles of them. Treatment is just to sweep them outside and off the decks. CARPENTER BEE SEASON - All summer long carpenter bees burrow into the wood all around decks, cabins, the endless trees around the area. They are harmless and buzz around not to harm you but to find the best place to have babies and leave their larvae. You may see at times huge piles of sawdust and that is evidence that the bees are burrowing. IF you see large gashes out of the side of a cabin that is from the woodpeckers who feed on the larvae and will tear up whole cabins to find all the bees. We do have the cabins treated to kill the bees and larvae to try and prevent the woodpeckers from damage. SCORPIONS - Small insects that are nocturnal hunters. They live off creepy crawlers so like spiders are our friends. Most TN residents have never seen a TN scorpion. They are drawn to wet locations like bathrooms or come out more when it has been raining. You do not want to be stung by an insect scorpion. It will hurt. Wear some type of whole while walking around inside the cabins especially at night. IF your not scared yet Remember their are RATTLESNAKES AND BEARS! Please see Cabin Manual for BEAR precautions Do's and Don'ts!Guest accessThe cabin is 100% accessible.DO NOT BOOK if you are 1. afraid of heights 2. afraid of being in the MTNs. 3. afraid of steep roads. 4. Looking for posh accommodations. Ready for the adventure! Please BOOK.Other things to noteThe adventure starts after you exit off the 321. Once you exit off and go toward the mtn remember to take in all the beautiful country. You will start the climb up the side of the mtn and be sure to follow the exact signs to Raven's Den. There are a quite few twists and turns. This cabin is accessible via a regular car as I have done it and my cleaners do it all the time.

3.	In the event Guest wishes to terminate this agreement, Travel Insurance, Damage Protection and any processing or administrative fees are non-refundable.  The refund policy is as stated on VRBO/AIRBNB or the booking site and is incorporated and made a part of this agreement:
4.	A payment of 100% is taken by Owner at the time of the booking.  
5.	A security deposit is required (""Security Deposit"") and will be automatically reserved for the booking.  The automatic reserve is conducted by putting a hold or charge on the Guest's credit card for the amount of $500.00 exactly 2 day(s) prior to the arrival date.  The credit card of the last successful payment will be used.  If there are no successful credit card payments, it is the responsibility of the Guest to send $500.00 by check to the Owner to satisfy the Security Deposit requirement.  If, at the end of the rental period, the rental property is returned undamaged beyond normal wear and tear, the Security Deposit will be released in full within five (5) business days.  In the event of any damages, Owner will provide Guest with a full accounting of expenses incurred and deductions made from the Security Deposit.  Should the damages exceed the amount of the Security Deposit, Guest agrees to pay the balance within five (5) business days after receiving notification.  Deductions from Security Deposit may include, but are not limited to: excess cleaning fee, hot tub draining and refilling fee, trash removal fee, missing item replacement costs, damaged item replacement or repair costs, repair costs of buildings or grounds, or other service call fees.  Owner is under no obligation to use the least expensive means of restoration.

Under no circumstances are pets allowed in pools or hot tubs.  Violation of this provision shall be grounds for expedited eviction and forfeiture of all monies paid.
9.	If linens or towels are rented from Owner or supplied with Rental Property, Guest is responsible for lost or damaged items at the cost of two (2) times the published standard rental price for such damaged or lost linens or towels.
10.
